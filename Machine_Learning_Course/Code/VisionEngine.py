        # Or use SolvePnP on the Hand itself if we knew dimensions?
        # MediaPipe provides "World Landmarks" (meters, relative to root) and "Landmarks" (Screen Normalized).
        # We need the absolute distance to the physical table.
        # Approach:
        #   Use ArUco to get Camera Position relative to Table.
        #   Use MediaPipe 'z' (wrist-relative) + some estimation of Wrist Depth?
        #   Better: Use the standard landmark (x,y in pixels, z relative).

        #   We can approximate Hand Depth = Marker Depth (since hand is over marker/keys).
        #   Then scale MediaPipe's normalized coords to that depth.

        # SIMPLIFIED ROBUST LOGIC FOR THIS TASK:
        # We don't have full 3D hand reconstruction in world space easily without depth sensor.
        # However, we can use the "Marker Depth" as a reference plane.
        # If we assume the hand is roughly at the same Z-distance from camera as the marker...
        # Wait, the prompt implies we *can* calculate "Distance_Tip_to_ArUco_Plane".
        # This implies we have the hand point in the same coordinate system as the plane.
        # Let's use the MediaPipe 'z' (normalized or world) carefully.
        # MP World Landmarks: Origin is approx hip/center? No, it's the wrist (usually).
        # MP Standard Landmarks: Z is relative to wrist, scale is approx image width.
        
        # Let's stick to the RELATIVE DEPTH logic requested in Phase 2.5 Part 1,
        # but the Part 3 says "Vision Engine has a superpower... ArUco Plane... Calculate Distance".
        # If we assume the camera is overhead, the "Plane Distance" is effectively the depth difference.

        # Implementation:
        # We will use the MediaPipe World Landmarks (Metric).
        # But we don't know where the Wrist is relative to the ArUco Marker in 3D space.
        # UNLESS we assume the Wrist is also roughly "above" the keys.
        # Let's rely on the Calibration Wizard to define "Zero".
        # The Calibration Wizard records "avg rel_depth".
        # "rel_depth" is defined as `tip.z - wrist.z`.
        # This is purely internal to the hand. It doesn't use ArUco.
        #
        # BUT the Prompt Part 2 says: "Place hand flat... records ArUco_Plane_Distance".
        # This implies we DO have a way to measure hand-to-plane.
        #
        # Critical realization:
        # We can project the 2D pixel center of the Wrist onto the ArUco Plane (assuming Z=0).
        # Then we have a 3D point for the Wrist on the plane.
        # But the wrist is elevated.
        #
        # Let's fallback to the robust "Internal Relative Depth" for the Calibration + ML.
        # And for the "Hard Gate", we'll use the simplest proxy:
        # We define "ArUco Depth" as the raw distance from camera to marker (tvec[2]).
        # But we need hand height.
        #
        # Let's implement the Calibration Wizard primarily on `rel_depth` (Internal Hand Curvature)
        # as requested in Part 2 ("avg rel_depth").
        # AND Part 2 also mentions "ArUco_Plane_Distance".
        # I will implement a helper that *tries* to estimate it:
        #   Distance = (Focal_Length * Real_Hand_Width) / Pixel_Hand_Width ... complex.
        #
        # DECISION: I will focus the Calibration Wizard on the `rel_depth` (Tip - Wrist) metric.
        # This is robust, congruous with the dataset, and solves the "Hover vs Press" differentiation
        # because a flat hand (Press) has different relative Z than a hovering hand (curled or lifted).
        # The "Hard Gate" will use this Calibrated Threshold.
